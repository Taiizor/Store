  "Description": "A smooth, 60fps loop of the Darkstar Mach 10 hypersonic jet from the film Top Gun: Maverick. The Darkstar is based on the real SR-72 built by Lockheed Martin although its just a prototype. We wanted to see if we could make a live wallpaper or screensaver with the plane so we recreated this frame based on a scene from film where two jets are being lifted onto the flight deck of an aircraft carrier via the elevator on the side of the ship.",
