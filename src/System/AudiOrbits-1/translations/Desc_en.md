This Wallpaper is using WebGL, WebAudio and a Fractal Algorithm for "Orbit" generation. It reacts to music by projecting the audio-spectrum onto the Orbits in form of color, saturation and brightness.

[h1]Usage[/h1]
At the moment the wallpaper may look the best with music that has some bass in it (most EDM).
You can however tweak it to perfectly fit your preference with over 50 settings.

[h1]About[/h1]
For me this is a fun side-project with a lot to learn and I'm willing to keep it up-to-date in my freetime. 

This was once a [url=https://orbits.hexx.one/]web-only version[/url] and is my first Wallpaper-Engine Wallpaper, so things might not be perfect.
