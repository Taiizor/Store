  "Description": "A 12-hour loop based on the scene from the film Contact (1997) where Ellie (played by Jodie Foster) travels through a wormhole and then finds herself on a tropical beach scene. I tried to match the style of the film and then also added some other elements like the nebula and storm clouds for a bit of visual interest. Mixed with some ambient ocean & gentle crashing waves sounds. Play it in the background while you study, relax, sleep or meditate. I hope you enjoy it!",
