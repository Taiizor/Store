  "Description": "Get away from the world and relax in this cozy wooden cabin. 12 hours of peaceful rain ambience with a crackling fireplace, gentle rainfall, and occasional distant lightning and thunderstorm sounds. Perfect for deep sleep, relaxation, and winding down after a long day, meditation, and studying. Or perhaps use it as a live wallpaper or screensaver which you can just leave playing as a background video. Rendered in 4K Ultra HD",
